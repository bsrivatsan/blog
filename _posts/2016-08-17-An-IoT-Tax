The botnet army is coming. What are we to do about it?

How about what we've been doing for decades in response to externality-inducing industry practices?

Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are rapidly taking up larger roles in our homes and lives - from obvious candidates like the [Echo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E) or [Google Home](https://home.google.com/) to less... conventional... items like [trash cans](https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/bincam-posts-photos-of-your-trash-on-facebook-shames-you-into-r/), [egg trays](https://www.amazon.com/Quirky-Minder-Wink-Enabled-Smart/dp/B00GN92KQ4), or [doggie doors](https://www.xively.com/customers/sureflap), more and more of our posessions are begging for the wifi password. This is a problem. If our terrible track record when it comes to protecting our computer passwords is any indication, expecting the general population to adequately protect their IoT devices is laughable ("Honey, what was the password for our toaster again?")

The dangers posed by Evil Toaster<sup>TM</sup> are twofold. Most customers, having watched Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (I would link to the movie but please save yourself the time and watch literally anything else instead), are aware that they are at risk from hacked devices undertoasting their bread or (on a more serious note) playing with home temperatures, leading to fires, invading privacy, etc. These issues, though, while serious, are likely to be mitigated over time. For one, each new apocalyptic blog article promising an IoT hack __just around the corner__ will contribute to growing customer pressure on the industry to safeguard against such threats. Federal regulations (if Congress ever gets off of their extended vacation) can do the same.

****The Botnet Army****

More worrying, though, is the possibility of Evil Toaster enlisting with siblings Evil Fridge, Evil Christmas Tree, and Evil Baby Diaper in the Botnet Army. By sending bad requests and packets to unprotected devices, hackers can piggyback off of the internet connections of mundane items to launch attacks or detect vulnerabilities.

One way this is already manfesting itself is through widespread Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. By overloading a service with traffic from a wide array of sources, DDoS attacks aim to crash websites and servers. While DDoS attacks have been around since at least 2000, only recently have random devices joined the call. A jewelry store's website was recently brought down by [25,000 hacked CCTV cameras](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/how-to-prevent-your-iot-devices-from-being-forced-into-botnet-slavery/); a similar botnet militia has attacked[two banks, two telcos, two government agencies, and three gaming companies.](http://www.securityweek.com/botnet-uses-iot-devices-power-massive-ddos-attacks)

It's not that solutions don't exist for these kinds of problems. Indeed, infosec startups are clamoring to enter the IoT space, with the industry set to [almost double in VC funding](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mergermarket/2016/06/07/cybersecurity-startups-set-for-surge/#2d0894701cae) during what many analysts view as a [relatively slow year in early-stage investments](https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2015/10/venture-pulse.html). Clearly, our issue isn't the lack of security startups with [badass homepages](http://www.norse-corp.com/).

The underlying issue is more likely the fact that we're facing a classic third-party-harm problem. Customers couldn't care less about some random gaming corporation halfway across the world, so vendors of IoT devices are disincentivized from pouring money into such solutions. If you'll indulge me by turning to page 354 of your Econ 101 textbooks, the solution is simple.

****A Tax on Toast****

We have a variety of weapons in our arsenal against negative externalities, including taxation, tort laws, and (in the case of climate change) a healthy dose of desperation.
