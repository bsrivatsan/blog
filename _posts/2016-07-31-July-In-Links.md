The coolest things I've seen/viewed/read this month:
- For those who say tech does nothing real-world-useful: [Ycombinator does UBI](https://blog.ycombinator.com/moving-forward-on-basic-income)
- Real-life bird whisperers (like Cesar but cooler): [The honeyguides](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/how-to-summon-the-bird-that-guides-you-to-honey/491924/)
- A fantastic novel based on protests in Seattle; poignant and strikingly applicable today: [Your Heart Is a Muscle the Size of a Fist](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Heart-Muscle-Size-Fist/dp/0316386537)
- One of the greatest speeches of this decade: [Michelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZNWYqDU948)
- An article that puts into perspective the events of the Turkish coup: [Turkey's "top counter-terrorism official... did go to a “meeting” at the presidential palace in Ankara. He was later found with his hands tied behind his back, shot in the neck"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials)
- Uplifting: [_Heroische Gelassenheit_](http://econ.st/2ax7U2C). If only all our nations could behave this maturely
- Gift ideas for my next birthday: [a mountain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/norway-finland-move-mountain-halti-halditsohkka-highest-peak)
- Seeing the rigid approach most Facebook chatbots take to conversing and the limitations of NLP apis when faced with rich, contextualized sentences, I've doubted for a while that the 'chatbot revolution' is here. Perhaps I'm not alone: [An updated Turing Test](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601897/tougher-turing-test-exposes-chatbots-stupidity/) and [when you should actually use a messaging bot](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/30/in-what-contexts-should-messaging-be-the-ui/) (ironic that TechCrunch has its own messaging bot that does nothing but send you articles to read) 
- Honestly, this is the future of computing: [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (watch the video)
- [Proof that sexism is embedded in our very language](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602025/how-vector-space-mathematics-reveals-the-hidden-sexism-in-language/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post). We have a promising future ahead of us if math and cs are used this way
- To the debaters who regurgitate the age old 'oh but rich people and corporations don't move around' argument: [Estonia begs to differ](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601998/this-tiny-country-thinks-virtual-citizens-will-make-it-rich/)
- Try your hand at this [NYT math puzzle](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html?_r=0)
